## 1 Comparison of the Effect of Vanishing Gradients on Neural Network – ReLU and Sigmoid
This notebook demonstrates the difference in the accuracy of neural networks using ReLU or Sigmoid as the activation function, giving an insight into the effect that the problem of vanishing gradients has on the sigmoid function. 

## 2 Bird Image Classification using CNN
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach to classify bird species from images. The dataset includes images of 525 bird species, with over 84,000 training images and 2,625 each for testing and validation. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/code/mesutssmn/bird-image-classification)

## 3 Sentiment Analysis in Japanese Texts
This project demonstrates a sentiment analysis model that categorises Japanese text as positive or negative. It uses MeCab for tokenisation and TensorFlow for building and training the model.

## 4 情報最終課題
This programme guesses whether a given tweet was posted by a man or a woman based on its writing style using a BERT model. It utilises a pre-trained Japanese BERT and fine-tunes it on custom-labeled data. This code was written as coursework of CS class in 2023.
